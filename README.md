git checkout -b branch-name

_do work in branch_

`git checkout master`

`git merge branch-name`

`git push ...` to wherever

`git branch -d branch-name` to delete branch locally

to push a branch other than master it’s `git push origin branch-name`

to delete a remote branch `git push origin --delete branch-name`

note that when working with staging or production we’re never using branches, you can only ever push to `master` branch with wpengine
